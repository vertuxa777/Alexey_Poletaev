Turn your magic on
Umi, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told him

Turn your magic on
To me, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again!
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said, I can't go on
Not in this way
I'm a dream, I die by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
