Turn your magic on
Umi, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends every day
That's what she told him

Turn your magic on
To me, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again!
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said, I can't go on
Not in this way
I'm a dream, I die by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on
To me, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds, taking shape
We are diamonds, taking shape

If we've only got this life
In this adventure, well, then I
And if we've only got this life
You get me through alive
And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, well, then I

Wanna share it with you
With you
With you
I said, oh
Say, oh

Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
